# Project Context: KelasRegB

## Directory Overview
This directory represents a newly initialized Git repository for a project named "kelasregb" located in a "web project" directory called "kelasmalam" (Indonesian for "night class"). The project appears to be in its initial setup phase.

## Current State
- Git repository has been initialized and connected to remote: https://github.com/gumgum-sys/kelasregb.git
- Contains a minimal README.md with only the project title "# kelasregb"
- QWEN.md file is being created to establish project context
- Empty .git directory indicates recent initialization

## Directory Structure
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\projek web\kelasmalam/
├── .git/           # Git repository files
├── QWEN.md         # Project context documentation (this file)
└── README.md       # Project title only (# kelasregb)
```

## Project Identification
Based on the directory name ("projek web" = web project) and folder name ("kelasmalam" = night class), this appears to be a web-based project, possibly related to an educational platform or night class system. The GitHub repository name "kelasregb" suggests it could be "class registration B" or similar.

## Technologies & Framework
At this time, no specific technologies or frameworks have been identified as no source code files are present yet. This appears to be a brand new repository ready for development.

## Purpose & Scope
This project appears to be set up for:
- Web development (based on directory name "projek web")
- Class registration or night class management system (based on directory "kelasmalam" and repo "kelasregb")
- Collaborative development (Git repository with remote)

## Next Steps
As this is a fresh repository:
1. Define project requirements and specifications
2. Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks (likely web-focused)
3. Establish development workflow and conventions
4. Begin developing the web application for class registration/night classes
5. Populate with source code, documentation, and configuration files

## Development Environment
- Operating System: Windows (based on path structure)
- Version Control: Git
- Remote Repository: GitHub (https://github.com/gumgum-sys/kelasregb.git)
- Local Path: C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\projek web\kelasmalam

## Notes
- This project is in early stages with only basic setup completed
- The actual purpose and functionality will become clearer as code is added
- Future documentation should include specific technology stack, setup instructions, and development guidelines
